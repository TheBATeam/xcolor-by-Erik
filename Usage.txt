     This plugin simply makes the use of the "color" command easier.


           Syntax: call xcolor [text color] [background color]    |   set the colors NOTICE: two equal colors dont work
           Syntax: call xcolor [help | /? | -h | -help]           |   get this message
           Syntax: call xcolor                                    |   get the colors (as seen below)
